           <p>Java is an object-oriented computer programming language that was created by James Gosling at Sun Miscrosystems in 1995. One of the main features of Java is that it was designed to minimize dependencies so that it could be run on any platform that supports Java - that means that Java could run on a Mac or a PC without requiring separate programming. The goal was to allow Java developers to "write once, run anywhere (WORA)". The popular game Minecraft is designed and runs entirely on Java.

           <p>Welcome to C#! You are about to begin your journey into the world of web development in the C# programming language.
            C#, pronounced see sharp, began development in the late 90's. Released as a part of the .NET Framework initiative in July 2000, C# is part of a family of computer languages which evolved out of the C/C++ Programming Language, which originated in the late 60's at Bell Labs.
            Today, C# is the object-oriented component of the ASP.NET Framework. Microsoft Chief Architect and C# team leader Anders Hejlsberg described it as an iteration and improvement of the C++ language. Hejlsberg touted C# as "the first component-oriented language in the C/C++ family." As a result, it is " a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language" and to be "economical with regard to memory and processing power requirements".
            C# is used as a stand-alone language, or an integrated part of larger applications. Many uses of C# are directed at applications which run on the Microsoft Windows operating system. Due to the integrating nature of the .NET Framework, C# is often one of many language solutions used.
